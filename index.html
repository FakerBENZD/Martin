  <div class="bir">  <h3>Birth and name change</h3>
    King was born Michael King Jr. on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, the second of three children to the Reverend Michael King Sr. and Alberta King (née Williams). King's mother named him Michael, 
    which was entered onto the birth certificate by the attending physician.
     Although, King Sr. would later state that "Michael" was a mistake by the physician.
     King's older sister is Christine King Farris and his younger brother was A.D. King
     King's maternal grandfather Adam Daniel Williams,who was a minister in rural Georgia,
      moved to Atlanta in 1893,and became pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in the following year.
      Williams was of African-Irish descent.

  <div class="ado"><h3>Adolescence</h3>In his adolescent years, he initially felt resentment against whites due to the "racial humiliation" that he, his family, and his neighbors often had to endure in the segregated South.
     In 1942, when King was 13 years old, he became the youngest assistant manager of a newspaper delivery station for the Atlanta Journal.
     King attended Booker T. Washington High School. 
     The high school was the only in the city for African American students.
     It had been formed after local black leaders including King's grandfather (Williams), urged the city government of Atlanta to create it. 
     King became known for his public-speaking ability and was part of the school's debate team.</div>
    <div class="key"> <h3>Montgomery bus boycott 1955</h3>
      In March 1955, Claudette Colvin—a fifteen-year-old black schoolgirl in Montgomery—refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in violation of Jim Crow laws, 
      local laws in the Southern United States that enforced racial segregation. 
      King was on the committee from the Birmingham African-American community that looked into the case;
       E. D. Nixon and Clifford Durr decided to wait for a better case to pursue because the i  ncident involved a minor.

Nine months later on December 1, 1955, a similar incident occurred when Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus.The two incidents led to the Montgomery bus boycott, which was urged and planned by Nixon and led by King.The boycott lasted for 385 days,and the situation became so tense that King's house was bombed
